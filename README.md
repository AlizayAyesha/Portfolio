Your default browser will open the website automatically.

Example URL when opened locally:

```
file:///path/to/your/project/index.html
```

### Option B ‚Äî Use VS Code Live Server extension

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Right-click on the `index.html` file.
3. Select **‚ÄúOpen with Live Server‚Äù**.
4. The website will open automatically, usually at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
   ```

This option is recommended for testing, as it allows automatic reloading when you edit files.
